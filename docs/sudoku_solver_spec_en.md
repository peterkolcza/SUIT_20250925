# AI-Assisted Sudoku Solver Specification

## 1. Project Overview
- **Context:** Internal 2025 autumn team-building challenge focused on AI-supported programming.
- **Goal:** Deliver a working Sudoku-solving application or algorithm that can correctly and quickly solve any standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzle.
- **Team Composition:** 3–4 people collaborating primarily through AI tooling instead of manual coding.
- **Primary Success Criteria:** Functional solver demo, adherence to AI-first workflow, positive presentation of learnings and outcomes.

## 2. Scope
- **In Scope:**
  - Sudoku puzzle solving core logic (input validation, solving, optional uniqueness check).
  - User-facing interface (CLI and/or web UI) to load puzzles and display solutions.
  - REST API endpoint for solving puzzles programmatically (optional but recommended for demo flexibility).
  - Automation of development tasks through AI assistants (code generation, refactoring, documentation).
  - Handling of one change request arriving in the afternoon session.
  - Documentation of architecture, AI usage, and retrospective insights for final presentation.
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Non-Sudoku puzzle types.
  - Multiplayer or competitive gameplay features.
  - Persistent storage beyond temporary in-memory or local files.
  - Advanced user management or authentication flows.

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Team Members:** Developers leveraging AI tools for design, coding, testing.
- **Facilitators:** Organizers monitoring progress checkpoints and issuing change request.
- **Audience:** Colleagues attending the final demo and presentation.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. **Puzzle Input:**
   - Accept 9×9 Sudoku puzzles via file upload, pasted text, or manual grid entry.
   - Validate that each row, column, and 3×3 subgrid contains digits 1–9 or blanks.
2. **Solve Puzzle:**
   - Produce at least one valid solution for any solvable puzzle within seconds on a standard laptop.
   - Report unsolvable or invalid puzzles with descriptive error feedback.
3. **Optional Uniqueness Check:** Indicate whether the puzzle has a unique solution when requested.
4. **Interfaces:**
   - **CLI:** Commands to solve from file/stdin and print solutions (grid/plain formats).
   - **Web UI:** Responsive form with grid input, validation feedback, Solve/Reset actions, example loader.
   - **API (Optional):** `POST /api/solve` accepting JSON board matrix and returning solution & uniqueness flag.
5. **Change Request Accommodation:** Implement the organizer-provided change late in the day and integrate into product.
6. **Status Reporting:** Share snapshots at the end of each workshop block (e.g., spec draft, MVP, post-change build).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Average solve time under 500 ms for typical puzzles; under 2 s for hardest cases.
- **Reliability:** Deterministic solver producing valid grids; automated tests for core solving logic and interfaces.
- **Usability:** Simple interface with clear instructions and error messages.
- **Maintainability:** Modular code, AI-generated documentation, and lint/test automation.
- **Compliance:** Follow AI-first development process and document AI contributions.

## 6. Constraints & Assumptions
- Must primarily rely on AI assistants (chat, IDE plugins) for ideation, coding, debugging.
- Team members may use unfamiliar stacks (e.g., Python, alternate JS frameworks) if supported by AI.
- Development time is limited to scheduled blocks: 10:30–12:00, 13:00–14:00, 16:30–17:30, plus final demos.
- Internet access is available for AI tools and shared repositories (Google Drive, GitHub, GitLab).

## 7. Solution Architecture
- **Core Solver Module:** Implements parsing, validation, solving algorithm (e.g., backtracking with heuristics or constraint propagation).
- **Interface Layer:**
  - CLI script wrapping solver module.
  - Web server (Flask/FastAPI/Node) exposing API endpoint and serving UI.
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS or chosen framework for grid interaction and API calls.
- **Testing Suite:** Automated unit/integration tests for solver, parser, API.
- **AI Workflow Integration:** Documented prompts, generated code snippets, and review checkpoints.
- **Change Management:** Branching/feature toggles or configuration to integrate late change without regressions.

## 8. AI Utilization Plan
1. **Knowledge Gathering:** Use AI to clarify Sudoku algorithms, technology options, and unfamiliar concepts.
2. **Design:** Prompt AI to co-create architecture diagrams, data models, and user stories.
3. **Implementation:** Generate boilerplate, solver logic, UI components, and tests via AI coding tools.
4. **Debugging:** Employ AI for troubleshooting errors, suggesting fixes, and improving performance.
5. **Documentation & Presentation:** Produce user guide, deployment steps, and final retrospective slide content with AI assistance.
6. **Change Request Handling:** Consult AI to analyze the new requirement, update design, and implement modifications rapidly.

## 9. Implementation Plan
| Phase | Time Slot | Activities | Deliverables |
|-------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Kickoff | 10:30–11:00 | Align on scope, collect AI references, set up collaboration tools | Shared repo/drive, AI prompt templates |
| Design | 11:00–12:00 | Draft architecture, data flow, UI sketches using AI | Draft specification (this document), backlog |
| Build Sprint 1 | 13:00–14:00 | Implement solver core + basic interface with AI support | Running solver MVP, initial tests |
| Build Sprint 2 | 16:30–17:00 | Harden features, improve UX, add tests, prep for change | Enhanced application, test coverage |
| Change Request | 17:00–17:20 | Analyze and implement organizer’s modification | Updated app + notes on change |
| Finalization | 17:20–17:30 | Prepare demo data, rehearse presentation, capture learnings | Demo script, presentation deck |
| Demo & Retrospective | 17:30–19:00 | Present solution, share AI usage experience, gather feedback | Live demo, retrospective summary |

## 10. Testing & Validation
- Unit tests for solver correctness and validation logic.
- Integration tests for CLI commands, API endpoint, and UI flows.
- Benchmarking script to measure solving speed for provided difficulty tiers.
- Manual testing of change-request scenario and error handling.
- Continuous testing triggered via `make` or CI workflow to ensure regressions are caught quickly.

## 11. Deployment & Tooling
- Local execution via Python virtual environment or chosen stack’s runtime.
- Optional containerization for consistent demo environment.
- Version control with Git; use branches/pull requests for change request integration.
- Shared artifacts stored in Google Drive/GitHub as per facilitator guidance.

## 12. Reporting & Documentation
- Update shared channel/document at the end of each time block with current status, blockers, and next steps.
- Maintain changelog capturing major AI-generated contributions and manual adjustments.
- Prepare final presentation summarizing objective, solution, AI learnings, and future improvements.

## 13. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Overreliance on unfamiliar tech | Delays due to setup issues | Validate feasibility with AI before committing; keep fallback stack ready |
| AI-generated code quality issues | Bugs or maintainability concerns | Peer review AI output; enforce tests and linting |
| Change request scope creep | Missed deadline | Timebox analysis; negotiate minimal viable implementation |
| Limited AI availability | Productivity drop | Prepare multiple AI tools/accounts; download offline references |
| Team coordination gaps | Duplicate work or merge conflicts | Frequent syncs, assign clear ownership, use shared backlog |

## 14. Acceptance Criteria
- Sudoku puzzles solved correctly within performance limits.
- Interfaces demonstrate smooth input, validation, and solution display.
- Change request implemented and showcased during demo.
- Documentation of AI usage and project outcomes delivered.
- Positive reception during final presentation (clarity, functionality, learnings).
